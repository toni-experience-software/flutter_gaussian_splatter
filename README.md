**üöß Early Developer Preview üöß**

This package is an early developer preview and is **not yet intended for production use**.

Flutter Gaussian Splatter showcases the use of Gaussian Splatting techniques within the Flutter framework. It leverages the power of [ANGLE (Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine)][angle_link] by Google, via the [flutter_angle][flutter_angle_link] package, to bring high-performance 3D rendering to Flutter applications.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a Flutter widget for rendering 3D scenes using Gaussian Splatting. It's a demonstration of what's possible when combining Flutter's ease of use with low-level graphics capabilities.

## Compatibility

The renderer has been tested on the following devices:
*   Silicon Mac
*   iPhone 13
*   Pixel 4
*   Pixel 5
*   Pixel 7

Due to the low-level nature of the graphics interface, you might encounter issues on other hardware configurations. If you experience any problems, please [open an issue][new_issue_link] on our GitHub repository.

## Known Issues

*   **Memory Leak:** A memory leak may occur when resizing the application window.
*   **Windows Rendering:** There are known rendering problems on the Windows platform.

## Basic Usage Example

To use the `GaussianSplatterWidget`, import the package and add the widget to your Flutter application. You'll need to provide the path to your `.ply` asset.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gaussian_splatter/widgets/gaussian_splatter_widget.dart';

class MyAwesomeApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyAwesomeApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Gaussian Splatter Demo'),
        ),
        body: const GaussianSplatterWidget(
          assetPath: 'assets/your_model.ply', // Replace with your asset path
          // Optional: showStats: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Make sure to add your `.ply` file to your `pubspec.yaml` assets:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/your_model.ply # Or your specific asset path
```
